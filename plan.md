**Fun fact:** In Tel Aviv for business during the first time Gaza rockets reached the city, http://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/on-the-ground-in-tel-aviv-as-hamas-rockets-reach-israels-second-largest-city/news-story/e62444ba27af7da3f183ecd4e8fbbd6a. Had no clue what was happening until it was over, never maid it to a shelter and saw the record hit the shore.<br/>

*Example of delivery in 2017 during [TrailheaDX](https://developer.salesforce.com/trailheadx), the yearly Salesforce Developer conference:*
‚ÄùThere was also a workshop run by Jules Weijters called **Salesforce DX and Continuous Integration**, that showed how to use Salesforce DX and Travis as CI systems. This was one of my highlighted sessions to attend. Unfortunately the session was so packed that the WiFi couldn‚Äôt provide internet for all of us and I couldn‚Äôt do the workshop. A real shame.‚Äù ‚Äî Source external [blog](https://labs.ebury.rocks/2017/07/12/trailheadx-2017-highlights/)
Countdown for FY19
